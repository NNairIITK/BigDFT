BFGS SDCG
300      ncount_cluster: max steps during geometry relaxation
5.d0  1.d-4    frac_fluct:     geometry optimization stops if force norm less than frac_fluct of noise
0.d0     randdis:        random amplitude for atoms
15.d0     betax: steepest descent step size,  if negative automatic determination
