     RANGE: [-500., 500.]
     default: 0
   elecfield:
     COMMENT: Electric field (Ex,Ey,Ez)
     DESCRIPTION: | 
      Uniform electric field Ex, Ey, Ez in units of Ha/Bohr.
      The electric field can not have components in periodic directions, e.g. Ex = Ez = 0 in case surface BC is used.
     default: [0., 0., 0.]
   nspin:
     COMMENT: Spin polarization treatment
     DESCRIPTION: |
            Spin polarization treatment;
            1 no spin (as LDA),
            2 spin-polarisation (LSD or collinear) and
            4 non-collinear i.e. two components per electron.

   mpol:
     COMMENT: Total magnetic moment
     DESCRIPTION: |
       Total magnetic moment which has to be the same parity as the total number of electrons (nelec_up-nelec_down=mpol).
       You should also define the keyword 'IGSpin' or add a spin per atom to specify the polarisation for the input guess.
     default: 0
   gnrm_cv:
     COMMENT: convergence criterion gradient
     DESCRIPTION: |
       Convergence criterion for the wavefunction optimization (norm of the gradient).
       Reasonable values are in most cases between 1.d-4 and 1.d-5.
     RANGE: [1.e-20, 1.]
     default: 1.e-4
     fast: 1.e-3
     accurate: 1.e-5
   itermax:
     COMMENT: Max. iterations of wfn. opt. steps
     DESCRIPTION: |
       Maximum number of gradient evaluations for a single cycle in a wavefunction optimization and maximum number of
       cycles. At the end of each cycle a subspace diagonalization is done which helps in cases where one has near
       degeneracy between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. 50 and 2 are usually sufficient.
     RANGE: [0, 10000]
     default: 50
   itermin:
     COMMENT: Min. iterations of wfn. opt. steps
     RANGE: [0, 10000]
     default: 0
   nrepmax:
     COMMENT: Max. number of re-diag. runs
     DESCRIPTION: |
       Maximum number of gradient evaluations for a single cycle in a wavefunction optimization and maximum number of
       cycles. At the end of each cycle a subspace diagonalization is done which helps in cases where one has near
       degeneracy between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. 50 and 2 are usually sufficient.
     RANGE: [0, 1000]
     default: 1
     accurate: 10
   ncong:
     COMMENT: No. of CG it. for preconditioning eq.
     DESCRIPTION: |
       ncong gives the number of iterations in the solution of the preconditioning equation. For free boundary
       conditions 5 is a good value whereas for other boundary condition a value from 0 to 2 is in general sufficient.
       
       Large values of ncong lead to a smaller number of iterations in the wavefunction optimization and better
       forces, but each iteration is more costly.
       So an optimal compromise value has to be found.
     RANGE: [0, 20]
     default: 6
   idsx:
     COMMENT: Wfn. diis history
     DESCRIPTION: |
       idsx gives the history length of the DIIS convergence
       acceleration in the wavefunction optimization. 6 is usually a good value for fast convergence.
       
       In case of convergence problems it can be advantageous to switch off DIIS by setting idsx = 0. The memory
       requirements grow considerably with large values of idsx.
       
       If memory is the limiting factor one has to choose idsx smaller than the value which gives the fastest
       convergence.
       The bigdft-tool tool can be used to predict the memory requirements for different choices of idsx.
     RANGE: [0, 15]
     default: 6
     low_memory: 2
   dispersion:
     COMMENT: Dispersion correction potential (values 1,2,3,4,5), 0=none
     DESCRIPTION: |
       A non-zero values activates an empirical add-on treatment of dispersion effects.
       
       The values 1, 2 and 3 specify different switching on functions using the convention.
     RANGE: [0, 5]
     default: 0
   inputpsiid:
     COMMENT: Input guess wavefunctions
     DESCRIPTION: |
       specifies how the input guess wavefunction is generated
       
       - InputPsiId = -2 Random numbers are used as input guess.
       his is of course a poor input guess which will need many iterations of the wavefunction optimization
       and might even lead to divergences.
       
        - InputPsiId = -1 The input wavefunction is imported from the CP2K code which uses Gaussian functions.
        The basis set should be contained in a file named gaubasis.dat whereas the coefficients should appear
        in the gaucoeff.dat file. Both files are the output files of CP2K code. See the H2O-CP2K test for an example. 
        
        - InputPsiId = 0 A subspace diagonalization in a minimal atomic basis set is used. This input guess should be
        used in general if one starts a new calculation.
       
        - InputPsiId = 1 The previously calculated wavefunctions (for instance from the previous geometry optimization
        step) are used as input guess. Setting InputPsiId to this value does only make sense from within a main program
        where call_cluster() subroutine was called previously. The old wavefunction is passed to the new call via the
        data structure restart.
        
        - InputPsiId = 2 The input wavefunction is read from the wavefunction. files which contain all the scaling
        function and wavelet coefficients. In case some parameters such as hgrids or crmult have changed, compared to
        the previous run, the wavefunctions will be also transformed to the new parameter set. Use also this value to
        restart from ETSF file format wavefunction-etsf.nc.
        
#        - InputPsiId = 10 The same as 0 but activates the ’Gaussian help’ after convergence the wavefunctions are projected
#        onto the localised basis set used for the input guess, and Mulliken Charge Population Analysis (MCPA) is performed on
#        this basis. The user has the possibility to perform MCPA with separate basis set (functionality to be added).
#        
#        -  InputPsiId = 11 Restart with Gaussian approximation contained in the ’restart’ data structure.
#        
#        - InputPsiId = 12 The input wavefunction is read from the wavefunctions.gau file, which contains an approximation in
#        a minimal Gaussian basis set of the previously calculated wavefunctions.
#

          approximation into a single wavefunctions.gau file otherwise into wavefunction. files. Writing a

   rbuf:
     COMMENT: Length of the tail (AU)
     description: |
       Far reaching tails of the wavefunctions decaying into the vacuum are added in a perturbative treatment if
       the variable rbuf is set to a strictly positive value. 
       This allows to do a calculation with some moderate value of crmult and then to extrapolate to the limit of
       large crmult. This procedure is not variational and gives too low energies.
       
       The true energy is in between the two energies and in general much closer to the extrapolated energy. 
       
       This procedure can also be used to judge whether the chosen value of crmult is large enough for a certain
       required precision. rbuf gives the amount by which the radii for the coarse resolution region are increased
       in atomic units. ncongt gives the number of iterations used in the perturbation calculation.

#Geometry Optimisation  and ABINIT Molecular Dynamics parameters
 geopt:
   DESCRIPTION: |
          This character string specifies the method used for the geometry optimization.
          
          - VSSD Variable Stepsize Steepest Descent method.
          
          - SDCG A combination of Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient.
          
          - LBFGS Limited Memory BFGS.
          
     #    - BFGS Preconditioned steepest descent with energy feedback. A preconditioning matrix is build
     #    up according to the BFGS algorithm. The initial Hessian is a diagonal matrix where the 
     #    diagonal elements are the inverse of the step size. This method is usually the most efficient
     #    one.
     #     
     #     - PBFGS Same as BFGS except that an initial Hessian is obtained from a force field. Force field
     #     parameters are only available for systems consisting of H,C,N,O. For such systems the method
     #     is the most efficient one in general
     #     
     #    - FIRE The Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine as described by Bitzek et al.[1] with optimized 
     #    parameters. An additional line is required in the input.geopt file with two parameters
     #    initial time step dtinit and the maximum time step dtmax. 
     ###    A good starting point to estimate dtmax is by using dtmax=0.25 pi sqrt(betax_(VSSD)) and
     #    dtinit=0.5dtmax, and gradually increasing dtmax. betax is not used.
          
     #    - AB6MD The molecular dynamic routines from ABINIT 6.
     #    
     #    - DIIS a Direct Inversion of Iterative Subspace. In that case, an additional parameter is required
     #    qqwith the history length (default is 4) on the line of betax.

   frac_fluct:
     COMMENT: Fraction of force fluctuations. Stop if fmax < forces_fluct*frac_fluct
     DESCRIPTION: |
       Convergence criteria for the geometry optimization.
       
       The geometry optimization stops either if the norm of the individual forces acting on any atom in the
       system is smaller than forcemax or if the forces get noisy.
       Noise is present because of the underlying integration grid. The parameter frac_fluct specifies how
       small the forces should become compared to the noise level to stop the geometry optimization.
       
       Values in between 1 and 10 is are reasonable for this parameter. A value of 2 means that the geometry
       optimization will stop when the largest atomic force is comparable to the 2 times the average noise
       in the forces themselves.
       For values of frac_fluct smaller than 1 one can under certain circumstances obtain better relaxed 
       geometries but one risks that the geometry optimization will not converge since the forces are too 
       noisy.
       
       In such a case one should closely monitor the progress of the geometry optimization by looking at the
       posout. files which are written at each step of the geometry optimization and at the data/geopt.mon 
       file.

   randdis:
     COMMENT: Random displacement amplitude
     DESCRIPTION: |
       This parameter allows to add random displacements with amplitude randdis to the atomic positions in
       the input file posinp.
       
       This can for instance be useful to break degeneracies (which would lead to convergence problems in
       the wavefunction optimization) in highly symmetric structures. 
     RANGE: [0., 10.]
     default: 0.
   betax:
     COMMENT: Stepsize for the geometry optimization
     DESCRIPTION: |
       This is the stepsize for the geometry optimization.
       
       This stepsize is system dependent and it has therefore to be determined for each system.
       If the VSSD method is used one can start with a small stepsize of around 1 and VSSD will suggest than
       a better value for {betax} in the last line of the data/geopt.mon file. Whether the stepsize is correct
       can also be seen from the data/geopt.mon output of the SDCG method.
       
       In this case the average stepsize in terms of betax should be around 4 (after a brief initial period
       where it is around 8).
       In contrast to the SDCG method, the BFGS method is not very sensitive to the correct stepsize but 
       nevertheless one should try to find reasonable values also in this case.

     COMMENT: Multiplying factors for the mixing
     DESCRIPTION: |
       The closer this value gets to one, the more cautious will be the mixing of the charge or potential.
       
       In the case of straight mixing, it corresponds to alpha according to
       
       rho_{new} <-- alpha rho_{old} + (1-alpha) - rho_{new}
       
       alphamix must be larger than one half.
