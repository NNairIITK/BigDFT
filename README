<p>BigDFT is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory" class="external">DFT</a> 
  massively parallel electronic structure code using a wavelet basis set.
  It was developed in an <a href="Project/index.html">European program</a>.
  Wavelets form a real space basis set distributed on an adaptive mesh (two
  levels of resolution in  our implementation). <a href="http://www.abinit.org/Psps/?text=../Psps/LDA_GTH/lda" class="external">GTH</a> or
  <a href="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cp2k/potentials/Goedecker/abinit/pbe/"
     class="external">HGH</a> pseudopotentials are used to remove the core electrons.
  Thanks to our Poisson solver based on a Green function formalism,  
  periodic systems, surfaces and isolated systems can be simulated with  
  the proper boundary conditions.</p>

<p>A <a href="BigDFT-manual.pdf"><img src="images/pdf-icon.png" class="icon" />
    manual</a> and some <a href="tutorials.html">tutorials</a> are also available.
  BigDFT is shipped with several built-in tests providing extensive
  examples of input files and capabilities.</p>

<p>The code BigDFT is available in
  <a href="http://www.abinit.org" class="external">ABINIT</a>, 
  v5.5 and higher but can also be downloaded in a standalone version from
  <a href="http://inac.cea.fr/L_Sim/BigDFT">this website</a>. The Poisson
  solver can also be downloaded and used independently. The
  Poisson solver is integrated in 
  <a href="http://www.abinit.org">ABINIT</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki">Octopus</a> and
  <a href="http://cp2k.berlios.de">CP2K</a>.</p>
