@brief Fitting of Goedecker type pseudopotentials with pseudo_2.2

@details
First of all: sorry that this description is not sooooo easy to
understand and the use of pseudo_2.2 is not self explaining! It took
me about one year to build LDA pseudopotentials for the whole periodic
system up to Rn. After all this time I still have no easy recepie 'how
to build a Goedecker pseudopotential from scratch' that works for each
element. The good news is that you can use the available LDA parameter
sets as a good initial guess to fit new pseudopotentials for other XC
functionals or different atomic reference states. The bad news is that
the procedure for building a Goedecker pseudopotentials is not as
simple as you may be used to from other pseudopotential schemes.  I
tried to include all important things into this README file but you
should not expect that everything is obvious after reading it once. I
recommend you to try some of the examples and to play around with the
program pseudo_2.2 for a while.

The program has been tested on IBM-RS6000/SP2, DEC-ALPHA and
CRAY/T3E. There are a few machine dependend calls. To get the desired
version search in the files psuedo.f and gatom.f for the stings 'CRAY'
and 'IBM/DEC' and comment/uncomment the corresponding lines.

The program pseudo_2.2 fits the parameters of a Goedecker
pseudopotential. The Goedecker pseudopotential has the form

Y_l,m(r) are the spherical harmonics.


The fitting is done by minimising a penalty function which incudes the
differences in the eigenvalues and charges between the all electron
atom and pseudo atom. For the atom of interest an all electron
calculation has to be done first using the program 'atom'. For using
the program 'atom' read the README file in the corresponding
directory.


@section Necessary          Necessary files for pseudo_2.2

1. 'atom.ae':     Contains all necessary data from the all electron
                  calculation. The file is created by the program atom. pseudo_2.2
                  uses the occupation numbers given in 'atom.ae' for the pseudo orbitals

2. 'FITPAR':      Determines which pseudopotential parameters have to be
                  fitted. 'FITPAR' has the form:
<pre>
  Fit                        Parameter

 </pre>
                  All parameters marked by a 't' will be fitted.

3. 'weights.par': Contains the weights for the penalty function
                  pseudo_2.2 minimises. pseudo_2.2 fits the pseudopotential parameters by
                  minimising the penalty function:

                     momentum must have zero nodes, the next higher orbitals must have one
                     node, ...)

               For each orbital there must be one line. The columns 4-11 of these

@section Invoking   Invoking pseudo_2.2

When invoking pseudo_2.2 without any arguments pseudo_2.2 performs a
single pseudo atom calculation for the pseudopotential parameters given
in the file 'psp.par'. The pseudo atom values are listed together with
the corresponding values of the all electron atom read from the file
'atom.ae'.  No fitting is done.

pseudo_2.2 recognises several command line options:
   + -cN       number of fitting cycles (-1< N < 10000)
   + -nN       number of iterations per simplex
   + -gN       number Gaussian
   + -rN       set rij=N/10 
   + -fullacc  use max. number of Gaussians
               (defined by the parameter ngmx in pseudo.f)
   + -orth     orthogonalisation of the projectors
   + -lith     transformation of the projectors as in lit.
   + -denbas   use dense Gaussian basis    
   + -ignore   override several warnings   
   + -info     append gaussian coefficients of final
               wavefunctions to psp.par
   + -plot     plot wfs after each iteration (write files)
   + -lNso     average nonlocal potential = 0 for l=N
               (only for the highest projector)

At the end of each run pseudo_2.2 writes out the file 'XX'. This file
contains the pseudopotential parameters in a form suited to be used
with CPMD. After invoking pseudo_2,2 with the option '-plot' the
wavefunctions can be plotted with 'gnuplot pswf.gnu'.


@section Fitthing       Fitting pseudopotentials

1. Before you fit any pseudopotential parameter edit the files
        'psp.par', 'FITPAR' and 'weights.par' so that they contain reasonable
        values. For the file 'psp.par' you can use the available LDA parameters
        as an initial guess. Another method is to use the parameters of a
        neighbouring element and edit the values for znuc, zion. The file
        'FITPAR' determines the parameters that are fitted - it depends on you
        which parameter you take for your pseudopotential, there is no unique
        best choice. Again you might take the already available LDA parameter
        sets as a guide. The file 'weights.par' influences the penalty
        function (see above) and thereby the fitting results. It is read by
        the program after every simplex cycle so by editing this file one can
        take influence on the fitting while the program pseudo_2.2 runs.

2. pseudo_2.2 uses Gaussians as basis functions. Before you start the
        fitting procedure you have to test if your basis set is sufficiently
        large.  The basis set is determined by the parameter ng and rij that
        are given in the file 'psp.par'. ng is the number of Gaussians that
        are used and rij determines the width of the smallest Gaussian. The
        larger the value of rij the smaller the lowest Gaussian that is
        used. Usually rij ranges from ~1.5 to ~4.0 and ng from ~14 to ~20.  To
        test if your basis is sufficient simply invoke pseud_2.2 without any
        argument and look at the residues for the interesting orbitals. The
        residue is a measure for the quality of the basis. As a rule of thumb
        the residue for a given orbital should be lower or at least equal to
        the error of the eigenvalue.

Examples: LDA-pseudopotential for Si with ng=12 and rij=0.7

The residue (at least) for the occupied orbitals should be ~1.0E-6. In
the case above the lowest Gaussians are not small/sharp enough to
allow a good description of the 3s orbital. Doing the same calculation
with ng=12 and rij=15 one gets:

Now the Gaussian basis works well for the 3s orbital but is inadequate
for higher s orbitals, as the highest Gaussians are not wide enough to
describe correctly the tails of these orbitals. Wider Gaussians are
simply added by increasing the value of ng i.e. the number of
Gaussians.  Doing the above calculation with ng=16 and rij=15 one now gets:

Now the Gaussian basis set is sufficient for a pseudopotential fit as
the residue for the occupied and next higher orbital is lower than
1.0e-6. The residues for the higher orbitals usually need not to be
that low.

To test different Gaussian basis sets it is not necessary to edit the
parameters ng and rij in the file 'psp.par'. It is easier to invoke
pseudo_2.2 with the command line options -gN (N=number Gaussians) and
-rN (set rij=N/10). pseudo_2.2 then uses for rij and ng the values
specified in the command line. If these command line options are used
together with the -cN option (N=number of fitting cycles) then the
values of rij and ng given in the file 'psp.par' will be overwritten
with the values specified in the command line after each fitting
cycle.

For some special cases (lanthanoides, 4d and 5d transition metals) the
set of Gaussian basis functions may not be dense enough, so that the
residue is too high for the lowest d- or f-orbitals even if one uses
very high values for rij and ng. In such cases one has to use the
command line option '-denbas'.

When fitting pseudopotential parameters one should not use more
Gaussians then required as the computational effort scales as ng**4.

To get a feeling how the basis set affects the results invoke
pseudo_2.2 for the above examples with the option '-plot' and look
with 'gnuplot pswf.gnu' at the resulting wavefunctions.

An additional method to check the basis set is to invoke pseudo_2.2
with the option '-info'. pseudo_2.2 then appends the coefficients of
the gaussian basis for each pseudo wavefunction to the file 'psp.par'.
For a good basis set the first and last coefficients of the gaussians
should be  very small.


3. To fit pseudopotential parameters invoke pseudo_2.2 with the command
line option '-cN' (N=number of fitting cycles). pseudo_2.2 then
performs N simplex optimisations. In most cases at least ~10
iterations are needed to get almost converged parameter sets even if
the initial guess was good. It is good politics to start pseudo_2.2
with -c50 or -c99 and to stop the program when no significant
improvement occurred during the last 5-10 iterations. Especially in
the case of heavy atoms one has to be carefully as convergence
sometimes is very slowly.

The program is able to treat the pseudopotential parameter rloc as a
fitting parameter. But in most cases it is better to keep rloc fixed
and fit the remaining pseudopotential parameters for some discrete
values of rloc. In addition treating rloc as a fitting parameter can
lead to some trouble and discontinuities between simplex iterations:
the Gaussian basis depends on the value of rloc and is calculated new
at the beginning of each simplex iteration. If rloc changes during one
simplex iteration the basis will not be the same in the following
simplex iteration sometimes resulting in different results for the
penalty function. (In many cases this effect can be avoided by using a
large basis i.e. increasing the values for rij and ng.) It is my
experience that it is better to fit parameters for different rloc
values and choose the best parameter set rather than fitting rloc
directly.

During the fitting you should frequently look at the output, if the
optimisation hang's up at some stage you can modify the penalty
function by editing the file 'weights.par'. if the optimisation shows
no improvement for more then 10 - 20 iterations and the results are
not sufficient you should interrupt the program and restart it with a
different initial guess. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that the
optimisation converges towards some sensible result if the initial
guess is 'far off'. In many cases the fitting is almost trial and
error.


If you want to stop the program during the optimisation create a file
named 'EXIT' in the working directory. The program will write its
actual results and stop. The file 'EXIT' will be removed. Creating a
file named 'NEXT' causes the program to stop the actual
simplex-cycle and to start the next one. This might be useful l if you
think the current simplex-cycle will give no further improvement.



@section Tricks     Hints and tricks

- after each optimisation always(!) plot the wavefunctions. If the
        pseudo wavefunction does not approach its all electron counterpart
        closely for larger r something went wrong. Look if the pseudo
        wavefunction has unwanted oscillations or nodes in the core region. if
        oscillations or nodes or shoulders occur refit the pseudopotential
        parameters by setting wfnode(i,1) and/or wfnode(i,2) and/or wfnode(i,3)
        for the affected orbitals to some larger value. for most cases
        wfnode(i,2-3) can be set to 0. usually is sufficient to test only the
        lowest orbitals of each angular momentum l for nodes. (Set wfnode(i,1)
        to some small value - i.e. 0.1 - and look at the output of
        pseudo_2.2.)


- H, He, Li(3e),...: set wghtp0=0 (weights.par); the 1s-pseudo
        wavefunction does not vanish at r=0!


- to do the calculation for the free atom (no confining potential) set
        rprb=1.0d6 in 'psp.par' and invoke pseudo_2.2 with the option
        '-ignore' (otherwise the program will stop as rprb has a different
        value in 'atom.ae').


- pseudopotentials for the 5d-elements neglecting the occupied
        4f-orbitals: modify the file 'atom.ae' after generation: reduce number
        of orbitals by 2, reduce zpseudo by 14 and delete the values for both
        4f wave functions (search for the string '4 3 ') modify also the files
        'psp.par' and 'weight.par' by killing the lines corresponding to the
        4f orbitals


- pseudo_2.2 is able to treat all functionals of the current CPMD
        version (V3.0). When there is no keyword for a certain functional
        modify the code of the routine 'pseudo.f': search for the string 'LDA'
        and look at the code...(The coding of the functionals by the variables
        mfxcx, mfxcc, mgcx and mgcc is the same as in CPMD(V3.0).)

       
- when you have to fit parameters of projectors that act only on
        unoccupied orbitals this can be done after optimising the remaining
        parameters as they do not influence the charge distribution of the
        pseudo atom and thereby the occupied orbitals. Example: the LDA
        parameter set for Bromine includes parameters for a projector for
        l=2. this projector acts on the 4d, 5d,... orbitals that are
        unoccupied in the ground state. At the first step of the fitting
        procedure these parameters are neglected by setting the penalty weights
        (in 'weights.par') for all d-orbitals equal zero and setting the
        values for all d-parameters in the file FITPAR equal false:

        This procedure usually converges faster than fitting all parameters
        simultaneously. Relevant cases are:
      +  3p-state: Na(Q=1), Mg(Q=2)
      +  4p,3d-state: K(Q=1), Ca(Q=2)
      +  5p,4d-state: Rb(Q=1), Sr(Q=2)
      +  6p,5d-state: Cs(Q=1), Ba(Q=2)
      +  5d-state: La(Q=3) - Yb(Q=24)
      +  4p-state: Sc(Q=3) - Zn(Q=2,Q=12)
      +  5p-state: Y(Q=3)  - Cd(Q=2,Q=12)
      +  6p-state: La(Q=3)  - Hg(Q=2,Q=12)
      +  4d-state: Cu(Q=1), Zn(Q=2) - Sr(Q=10)
      +  5d-state: Ag(Q=1), Cd(Q=2) - Ba(Q=10)
      +  6d-state: Au(Q=1), Hg(Q=2) - Rn(Q=8)
        All listed pseudo orbitals can be fitted separately as there is no
        occupied (pseudo)orbital with same angular momentum.


- when you use the files 'FITPAR' and 'weights.par' that are available
        together with the corresponding LDA parameter sets for a new fit,
        look if the values in 'FITPAR' and 'weights.par' correspond to a fitting
        of the unoccupied orbitals (see above) - you may have to change
        this before optimising the whole parameter set.


- when you fit pseudopotentials starting from one of the available LDA
        parameter sets always look if the highest average coefficient of a
        projector is zero (look up the values listed in the output of a single
        pseudo atom calculation with pseudo_2.2 after 'nonlocal part as
        V_average + V_so'). If you want to use the equivalent parameter set
        for you fit invoke pseudo_2.2 with the option '-lsoN' where N refers
        to then angular momentum l. In this case the highest coefficient of
        the projector for angular momentum l only affects the splitting of the
        corresponding orbitals. This coefficient also does not appear in the
        pseudopotential parameter file 'XX' for CPMD. The file 'XX' only
        contains the scalar relativistic potential. Examples are the
        Lanthanoides La - Lu: here the highest average expansion coefficient
        of the p-projector is zero.


- pseudo_2.2 writes out the wavefunctions into files named
        'ps.n[s,p,d,f]ibyj.dat'. n is the main quantum number and ibyj refers
        to the multiplicity (J=i/j) of the orbital (in non relativistic
        calculations ibyj is missing). Example: the file 'ps.4p1by2.dat'
        contains the pseudo wavefunction corresponding to a 4p spin down
        (J=1/2) orbital whereas the file 'ps.4p3by2.dat' contains the pseudo
        wavefunction corresponding to a 4p spin up (J=3/2) orbital. Each line
        of these files has the form: r, psi_ae(r)*r, psi_pseud(r)*r,
        |psi_ae(r)-psi_pseudo(r)|*r. As these files are thought for plotting
        they do not contain all grid points used in the calculation. If you
        need to know the wavefunction on the complete grid you have to modify
        the code in routine pseudo_2.2: comment the line ' call
        detnp(ngrid,rae,5*rcov,np)' and insert the line ' np=ngrid'.


- to get a feeling what is a good fit and what is a bad fit for a
        certain atom run pseudo_2.2 with the LDA parameter set. Look at the
        errors of the eigenvalues and charges and plot the pseudo
        wavefunctions together with their all electron counterparts. This may
        serve as a guideline. The value of the penalty function is no ultimate
        quality criterion. It is only as weights sum over different errors!


- in its default fitting mode pseudo_2.2 uses the simple projectors
        p_i^l(r) and no constraints for the h_ij^l.  if you want to use the
        same transformations as in PRB ??, C.Hartwigsen, S.Goedecker and
        J.Hutter) invoke pseudo_2.2 with the option '-lith'.  If you want to
        use parameter sets with simple projectors (as given in Phys. Rev. B
        54, 1703 (1996)) invoke pseudo_2.2 without the options '-orth' or
        '-lith'. it is possible to use orthonormal projectors by invoking
        pseudo_2.2 with the option '-orth'. These orthonormal projectors
        P_i^l(r) and the corresponding matrix H(ij) have to be constructed by
        matrix-multiplications:
        <pre>
         U (p_1^l(r),p_2^l(r),p_3^l(r)) = (P_1^l(r),P_2^l(r),P_3^l(r))
         U h(ij) UT = H(ij) ; UT = transposed(U).
        </pre>
        The transformation matrix U, the P_i^l(r) and the matrix elements H_ij
        are written out at the end each run whenever the command line option
        '-orth' is used. Nevertheless the file 'psp.par' always contains the
        matrix elements h_ij^l! We strongly recommend the use of the option
        '-orth'! The nonlocal part of the pseudopotential then can be
        calculated avoiding the double sum over i,j:
        <pre>
                              3    l                                                
                             ---  ---                                                
                           l \    \                     l     l        l  *        
         dV_l(r_1,r_2)=(-1)   )    )  Y_l,m(r_1) P_i(r_1) H_ii  P_i(r_2) Y_l,m(r_2).
                             /    /                                                
                             ---  ---                                                
                             i=1 m=-l 
        </pre>
        The use of orthonormal projectors also avoids any linear dependencies
        during the fit. As long as pseudo_2.2 does transformations of the
        matrix h(ij) (both options '-lith','-orth') the off diagonal terms
        h_ij for i<>j are calculated from the the diagonal terms (i.e. the
        h_ii's). So do not worry if the program changes the values of
        expansion coefficients of projectors that are not marked as fitting
        parameters in 'FITPAR'. In this case pseudo_2.2 prints a warning at
        the beginning. Comparable pseudopotentials for the same elements using
        different transformations for the h_ij can easily be constructed for
        most cases by refitting the h_ij of a given pseudopotential while
        keeping all other pseudopotential parameters fixed. Sometimes
        refitting of the corresponding r_l will be neccessary.


- softness considerations: For certain applications you may want to
        create a softer pseudopotential than the already available LDA
        pseudopotentials. There are several ways: you can slightly increase
        the values of rloc and r_l() and keep them fixed during a subsequent
        re-fitting of the remaining parameters. This leads to a less steeper
        local potential and less localised projectors and thereby to a softer
        pseudopotential (unfortunately this does not necessarily mean that the
        corresponding pseudo wavefunctions also get softer!). A second way is
        to get rid of the localised Gaussians of the basis set pseudo_2.2 uses
        by decreasing the value of rij ('psp.par'). Setting the weights
        ('weights.par') for the residues of the lowest orbitals to some high
        value forces pseudo_2.2 to generate potentials for which the pseudo
        wavefunctions are well represented by a basis with no sharp Gaussians
        which again corresponds to a lower cutoff energy when using a plane
        wave basis set. Warning: never try to make a pseudopotential too soft

        
- i.e. be aware that you trade accuracy for softness! In many cases a
        harder but more accurate pseudopotential will yield better results at
        even moderate cutoff energies.


- if you (re)construct the pseudopotential parameters for the file
        'psp.par' from a pseudopotential parameter file used for CPMD
        (i.e. files with a format like the 'XX' files) be careful: the
        sequence of the expansions coefficients of the projectors can be
        different! To find out the correct order look at the available LDA
        parameter sets - there you find both the 'XX' and 'psp.par' files. For
        relativistic atoms the parameters in the file 'XX' are not identical to
        'psp.par' as the only contain the scalar relativistic part
        (i.e. average potentials) and spin orbit couplings are neglected. You
        might also look at the source code of the routine 'pseudo.f' where the
        files 'psp.par' and 'XX' are created.


- if you are interested in the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the
        free pseudopotential (no confining potential) simply set the value for
        rcov in 'psp.par' to some large value and invoke pseudo_2.2 with the
        option '-ignore'. (do not worry if now the errors for the eigenvalues
        and charges relative to the ae atom are large - the ae atom results
        still refer to the confining potential!)


- maybe you want to test the transferability of your pseudopotential by
        calculating the total energy of the pseudo atom in different
        electronic states and compare the excitation energies with those of
        the all electron calculations. to do so simply use the corresponding
        files 'atom.ae' that are generated by the program 'atom' for the
        atomic state you are interested and invoke pseudo_2.2 with the option
        '-ignore'. pseudo_2.2 then calculates the total energy of the pseudo
        atom for the electronic configuration stored in 'atom.ae' even if this
        configuration is not consistent with the parameters stored in the file
        'psp.par'.


- for some applications you will need the wavefunctions of the scalar
        relativistic pseudopotentials (as stored in 'XX') rather than the
        wavefunctions of the fully relativistic pseudopotential (stored in
        'psp.par'). To calculate these wavefunctions you first have do redo
        the atomic calculation for the non relativistic atom with the program
        'atom'.  Therefore change the corresponding line in the file
        'atom.dat' from ' rel' to ' non' and run the program 'atom'. For the
        pseudo atom calculation use the new file 'atom.ae'. Edit the file
        'psp.par' created by atom and fill in the parameters of the scalar
        relativistic pseudo atom given in the file 'XX'. Be careful: the
        sequence of the expansions coefficients (hij) of the projector
        functions can be different in 'XX' and 'psp.par'. The 'psp.par' file
        now only contains one line per angular momentum as there are no longer
        spin up and spin down states for l>0!  for the parameters ng, rij ,
        rcov and rprb use the old values of the fully relativistic
        pseudopotential. You also have to edit the 'weights.par' file - there
        is now only one orbital for each n and l>0!  Now run pseudo_2.2 with
        the option '-plot'. The wavefunctions of the scalar relativistic
        pseudopotential are stored in the files 'ps.*.dat' afterwards. Do not
        worry if the pseudo atom wavefunctions do not closely fit their all
        electron: the all electron wfs correspond to a classical atom whereas
        the pseudo wfs correspond to a scalar relativistic
        atom. (Unfortunately the atomic program is unable to treat the scalar
        relativistic all electron atom.) An example for an scalar relativistic
        pseudo atom is given in the directory './EXAMPLE/SCREL'. If you
        inspect the files stored there things should become clear!


- in an older version of the program wfnode(i,n) had an different meaning:
         wfnode(i,n) was the ordinate of the outermost node of the
        wavefunction (or its higher derivatives for n=2,3)) if this node is
        not allowed (the lowest orbitals of each angular momentum must have
        zero nodes, the next higher orbitals must have one node, ...). this
        sometimes resulted in a discontinuous the penalty function resulting
        resulting in a slower optimisation of the pseudopotential. By
        replacing the direct contribution of the ordinates of the nodes to the
        penalty function by the integral of the (wave)function between this
        nodes  we obtain an continuous penalty penaltyfunction.( For
        pseudo wavefunctions with the correct nodal structure both versions of
        the penalltyfunction have the same value!) The new version has the
        advantage that small oscillations of the wavefunction in the core
        region give a smaller contribution to the penalty function as large
        oscillations with the same node locations. Due to the change in the
        meaning of  wfnode(i,n) it might be necessary in some cases to change
        the corresponding weights in the file 'weights.par'. If you want to
        use the old version of the penalty function you have to edit the file 
        'gatom.f': uncomment the three lines following 
        'c     old version for nodes as used in the paper:' 
        and comment the three lines following
        'c     new version, using the integrals of the functio...'
        Nevertheless we STRONGLY recommend th use the new version.

- the version used for generating the pseudopotentials published in 
        PRB ??? contained an error in the calculation of the second
        derivative of the pseudo wavefunction. Therefore it might happen that
        the pseudo wavefunctions of some heavier elements exhibit a small,
        unwanted shoulder in the core region. By refitting the pseudopotential
        with appropriate weights this shoulder dissappears. Nevertheless the
        published pseudopotentials will already work in atomic and molecular
        calculations!

- to give you an idea about the cpu-time needed for fitting an
        pseudopotential, here are some benchmarks. the listed timings may only
        serve as a guideline, as the have been obtained with an older version
        of the program - they also depend on wether you use an special
        LAPACK/BLAS library for you machine or use the supplied source-code
        (and of course: they depend on the pseudopotential!).

@section Examples Example: Creating a PBE-Pseudopotential for Gold using the available LDA parameter SET (11-electron PSP)

1. Copy the file './EXAMPLE/atom/atom_au.lda.dat' to
'./EXAMPLE/atom/atom.dat'. Edit the file atom.dat and change the
keyword for the XC-functional from 'PADE' to 'PBE':
<pre>

Now run the program atom. If you are interested in the all electron
wavefunctions or the atomic XC-potential you can plot the files
'ae.*.dat' and 'Vxc.dat', respectively. Otherwise you can simply
remove them. (In the current example we use the files 'weights.par'
and 'psp.par' from the already available LDA parameter sets. So you
can also remove 'weights.par' and 'psp.par' that are generated by
atom)

If you have any problems with the ae calculations consult the 'README'
for the program "atom".

2. Copy the file 'atom.ae' to the directory './EXAMPLE/psp/'. Copy the
file './EXAMPLE/psp/psp.par_PADE' to './EXAMPLE/psp/psp.par'. Edit the
file 'psp.par' and change the XC-functional from 'PADE' to 'PBE'. The
head of the file 'psp.par' should now look like:

 18     3.00000 ng, rij
 2.700  5.400   rcov,rprb
 r               (non)relativistic calculation
 PBE             XC-functional
....

Edit the file 'weights.par' and set all weights for l=1 angular
momentum orbitals equal zero. The parameters for the projectors acting
on the l=1 orbitals can be fitted separately as the pseudo atom has no
occupied p-orbital. 'weights.par' should now look like:

edit the file 'FITPAR' and set all parameters that have to be fitted
equal .true.; 'FITPAR' now should look like:
<pre>
  Fit                        Parameter
 f    t f f f                rloc,gpot(1,..,4)
            2                lmax
 t    t f t f f f            r_l(1),h11,h12,h22,h13,h23,h33 (l=0)
 f    f f f f f f            r_l(2),h11,h12,h22,h13,h23,h33 (l=1)
 t    t f t f f f            r_l(3),h11,h12,h22,h13,h23,h33 (l=2)
 f    f f f f f f            r_l(4),h11,h12,h22,h13,h23,h33 (l=3)
</pre>

The last line of 'FITPAR' can be deleted (if you like) as there is no
projector for l=3 (lmax=2).

Now invoke the program pseudo_2.2 with the options '-c99 -denbas':
'nice +19 pseudo_2.2 -denbas -c99 >! out &' and look frequently at the
output. (The option '-denbas' is necessary because of the localised
6d-states. It is unnecessary for the fitting of most other elements.)

If the fitting procedure has sufficiently converged and there is no
significant improvement over several subsequent fitting cycles (in the
current example approximately 10-20 cycles) stop further fitting of
the parameters affecting the occupied orbitals and start fitting the
parameters for the projectors acting on the l=1 orbitals. To do this
modify the files 'FITPAR' and 'weights.par' in the following form:
<pre>
  Fit                        Parameter
 f    f f f f                rloc,gpot(1,..,4)
            2                lmax
 f    f f f f f f            r_l(1),h11,h12,h22,h13,h23,h33 (l=0)
 t    t f t f f f            r_l(2),h11,h12,h22,h13,h23,h33 (l=1)
 f    f f f f f f            r_l(3),h11,h12,h22,h13,h23,h33 (l=2)
 f    f f f f f f            r_l(4),h11,h12,h22,h13,h23,h33 (l=3)
</pre>

You can change the files 'FITPAR' and 'weights.par' whenever you like
while pseudo_2.2 is running. It is unnecessary to stop pseudo_2.2! The
modified file are read by pseudo_2.2 as soon as pseudo_2.2 starts a
new fitting cycle.

Look at the output of pseud_2.2 and stop the program when the results
are sufficiently converged.

3. Test the fitting results of pseudo_2.2 with the command 'pseudo_2.2
-fullacc -denbas -plot'.  Look at the output and carefully check the
results. To look at the all electron and pseudo wavefunctions type
'gnuplot psw.gnu' or plot the files 'ps.*.dat' with any other plotting
program you like.
