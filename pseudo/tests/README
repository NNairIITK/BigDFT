@dir ./pseudo/tests
@brief Tests for atom and pseudo programs.

@details
This directory contains:
- atoms           Tests only the atom program;
- H-pseudo        Tests the pseudopotential generation for Hydrogen atom;
-  example-O.new  Test from Alex Willand (this directory is old and should be removed. 
                  This is exactly the same test as the directory pseudo/tutorials/oxygen.NLCC).
- pawpatchtest    Tests the PAW patch.

@dir ./pseudo/tests/atoms
@brief Tests for many atoms the atom program.

@details
The initial import has tests for atom.f with a wide variety of chemical elements,
but only in relativistic Teter93 LDA (iXC = - 000 020 or 1, nspol=1).

Added some tests for nitrogen in polarized and nonrelativistic LDA and PBE,
as well as one test with VWN LDA, no confinement and several configurations (to compare with NIST DFT data).

There are no tests for the fitting application pseudo yet. 
Some crossover of tutorial and test for pseudo is found in ./example.O/INSTRUCTIONS.
