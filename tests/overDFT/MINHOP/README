example to use the minima hopping method.

Input Files are:
 - CPUlimit:   CPUlimit in hours
 - earr.dat:   First line,  # of minima found and # of minima to be found
               Second line, Eref  (Reference energy) stop if less than that
               Third line,  accur Accuracy for rounding
 - input.dat   Used for the first optimization of geometry
 - ioput       First line, Ediff (Difference energy) to reject minima or not if > Ediff
 - poscur.xyz  Initial and current position
 - rand.inp    Seed of random number generation
