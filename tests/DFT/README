@brief Non-regression tests (ground-state calculations)

Tests the ground-state calculation capabilities.
The command <tt>make check</tt> performs the series of tests:
- @subpage TESTS_DFT_CUBIC   Tests the cubic version capabilities;
- @subpage TESTS_DFT_LINEAR  Tests the linear version capabilities;
- @subpage TESTS_DFT_POSTSCF Tests some post-processing after a ground-state calculation.
