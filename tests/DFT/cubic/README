@page TESTS_DFT_CUBIC Test the cubic version of the code.
@brief Non-regression tests (ground-state with the cubic version)

Tests the ground-state calculation capabilities for the cubic version.

The command <tt>make check</tt> performs the series of tests:
- @b AgBulk:      Tests bulk Silver periodic boundary conditions, with an example for mixing and k-points
- @b Ca2:         Tests adaptive mesh (by checking symmetry)
- @b C:           Tests non-local pseudo-potential for isolated system. 
                  We use the file occup.dat in order to populate equally the 3 p states.
                  WARNING: The input guess has not the correct symmetry due to the lapack library.
                  There is a small overlap (1.e-6) between s and p states in Gaussian functions projected into wavelet basis sets
                  and the 3 eigenvalues of p states are a diffrence of 1.e-6. 
- @b ElectField:  Tests the calculation when electric filed is applied in an arbitrary direction.
                  If rotated, the forces (only magnitude!) should be conserved. The energy (because of different ref. for external potential can be different)
- @b ElectronGas: Tests no atoms and k points with random input wavefunctions
- @b FeHyb:       Tests the hybrid functional
- @b GPU:         Tests GPU code (CUDA).
                  To use GPU capabilities, you should use the option --enable-cuda with configure,
                  add 'accel' keyword in input.perf with value 'CUDAGPU' 
                  (this keyword indicates that the special GPU interface is used for convolutions) 
                  and have a file for the affinity: cpu_gpu_aff.config
- @b Graphene:    Tests surface with k-points for a graphene sheet
- @b H2O-CP2K:    Tests import wavefunctions from a gaussian basis set
- @b H2-spin:     Uses the spin in the calculation of hydrogen atom
- @b H:           Tests the hydrogen in a periodic box
- @b Li+:         Calculates an isolated charged system
- @b Mn2:         Tests non-collinear spin
- @b NaCl:        Tests non-local pseudo-potential and adaptive mesh
- @b OCL:         Tests GPU code (OpenCL)
                  To use GPU capabilities, you should:
                  - Use the option --enable-ocl with configure
                  - Add a keyword accel in the file input.perf with value:
                  OCLGPU this keyword indicates that the special GPU interface is used for convolutions
- @b SiBulk:      Tests bulk silicon in periodic boundary conditions
- @b SiH4:        Tests the geometry relaxation for the silane molecule. Use the ASCII file format instead of the XYZ one
- @b TiMix:       Tests the diagonalisation and mixing scheme using a Pulay algorithm on density
- @b TiMix:       Tests for different smearing methods: gaussian, fermi, marzari, ...
- @b TiSmear:     Tests a different smearing method: Marzari'c cold amearing (could be changed for other methos as well)
