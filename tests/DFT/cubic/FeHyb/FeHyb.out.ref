       ~19*K         |     W+(~4)*U+D+K+P   |   ~12*D+K+W+P  |    ~W+(~5)*U+D+K+P

 The overall memory requirement needed for this calculation is thus: 68 MB
 By reducing the DIIS history and/or increasing the number of processors the amount of
  memory can be reduced but for this system it will never be less than 58 MB
