SDCG
2         ncount_cluster: max steps during geometry relaxation
1.d0  0.  frac_fluct:     geometry optimization stops if force norm less than frac_fluct of noise
0.d-0      randdis:        random amplitude for atoms
0.5d0      betax: steepest descent step size,  if negative automatic determination
